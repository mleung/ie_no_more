IeNoMore
========

We hate IE6. I'm sure you do as well. This plugin was born of that hate. So ie_no_more is really
our attempt at making the world a better place. 

We're altruistic philanthropic idealists, if you will.

Example
=======

Throw this in your application layout, and do your part making IE6 go the way of velcro. 

<%= smack_down_ie6 %>

You can also conditionally hide or show parts of your app if it is IE:

<% hide_if_ie6 do %>
  # No specific ie code
<% end %>

<% show_if_ie6 do %>
  # Specific ie code
<% end %>

Message
========

If you'd like to customize the output message, just go into app/views/ie_no_more 
and go to town on the _ie_upgrade_message partial. 


Styles
=======

You can customize the display of the output message using CSS. Just throw the 
styles in your style sheet. Here's some examples:

#ie-no-more-container {
  background: #FFFFCC;
  border: 1px solid #FF9933;
  width: 90%;
  margin-left: 2%;
  margin-right: 2%;
  padding: 20px;
}

#ie-no-more-container p {
  margin-top: 5px;
}

#ie-no-more-container ul {
  padding: 10px 0 0 1px;
  list-style: none;
}

#ie-no-more-close-button {
  float: right;
}
